"""Anvil — The open-source, self-verified coding agent.

Generate → Execute → Verify → Recover.

Every other open agent generates and hopes. Anvil generates, runs,
checks, and fixes — because it was trained on 210,000 examples of
real agents doing exactly that.

The core loop:
    1. PLAN     — Decompose task into atomic steps
    2. EXECUTE  — Run each step with real tools
    3. VERIFY   — Check the output actually works (syntax, tests, lint, type)
    4. RECOVER  — If verification fails, diagnose and fix automatically

This isn't prompt engineering. This is behavior engineering.

v2 adds multi-agent support (switching, @mention, custom agents)
and a fine-grained permissions system.
